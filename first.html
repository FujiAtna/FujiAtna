<article>Welcome to Big Data For Dummies. Big data is becoming one of the
most important technology trends that has the potential for dramati-
cally changing the way organizations use information to enhance the cus-
tomer experience and transform their business models. How does a company
go about using data to the best advantage? What does it mean to transform
massive amounts of data into knowledge? In this book, we provide you with
insights into how technology transitions in software, hardware, and delivery
models are changing the way that data can be used in new ways.
Big data is not a single market. Rather, it is a combination of data-manage-
ment technologies that have evolved over time. Big data enables organiza-
tions to store, manage, and manipulate vast amounts of data at the right
speed and at the right time to gain the right insights. The key to understand-
ing big data is that data has to be managed so that it can meet the business
requirement a given solution is designed to support. Most companies are at
an early stage with their big data journey. Many companies are experiment-
ing with techniques that allow them to collect massive amounts of data to
determine whether hidden patterns exist within that data that might be an
early indication of an important change. Some data may indicate that cus-
tomer buying patterns are changing or that new elements are in the business
that need to be addressed before it is too late.
